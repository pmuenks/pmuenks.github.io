This respository contains the files to replicate my final project for EPPS 7V81. The raw data work can be completed by running the Python file first and then the R file.

The Python file will create a .csv file which is meant to be read into the R script; the user will need to update the location of the df_full.csv file. Additionally, the County.shp will need to be read into R for the script to compile. Both files are availabe for download in the repository.

The RMarkdown Script will need the user to set the location for the following files: df_full.csv, County.shp, Muenks EPPS 7V81.bib
